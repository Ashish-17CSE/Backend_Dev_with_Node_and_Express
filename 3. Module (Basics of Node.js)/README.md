# Simple Node.js Server Example

This repository contains a simple Node.js server that listens on port 4000 and responds with a message containing the name "Ashish".

## About the Project

The server is created using Node.js's built-in 'http' module. The server code is located in the 'Localhost.js' file and consists of a basic HTTP server setup that listens on port 4000. When you visit the server URL in your browser or make an HTTP request, it responds with a message containing the name "Ashish".
