# Booking App Project Overview

## Introduction

The Booking App is a web-based application designed to simplify the management of booking-related information. It offers a user-friendly interface for users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data. This application is built using Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize (a MySQL ORM), and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front-end.

## Features

### 1. User Management

- Users can add new entries with their name, phone number, and email, which are essential for booking purposes.

### 2. User Listing

- The application provides a clear and organized list of all users in a tabular format, making it easy to view and manage user information.

### 3. Edit User Information

- Users have the option to edit existing user information, such as their name, phone number, and email, ensuring that accurate and up-to-date details are maintained.

### 4. Delete Users

- The application allows for the removal of user data from the database, providing a streamlined process for user data management.

### 5. Responsive Design

- The application features responsive design elements, ensuring usability across various screen sizes and devices.

## Project Structure

The project follows a well-structured file organization to maintain code readability and scalability:

- **controllers**: Contains the back-end controller logic, responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **models**: Houses the Sequelize model definitions for database tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- **public**: Includes the front-end assets, such as CSS and JavaScript files, responsible for user interface functionality and styling.
- **routes**: Defines the Express.js routes for handling different API endpoints and routing requests to the appropriate controllers.
- **util**: Contains utility files, including the database configuration (`util/database.js`), to ensure modularity and code separation.
- **views**: Stores the HTML and EJS templates for rendering the front-end views, enhancing the user interface.

## Database Setup

This application uses MySQL as its database. You can configure the database connection in the `util/database.js` file. Ensure that you have MySQL installed and running before starting the application.

## API Routes

The application follows a RESTful API pattern, where HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used to perform CRUD operations on user data:

- **GET /users**: Get a list of all users.
- **POST /users**: Create a new user.
- **PUT /users/:id**: Edit a user by ID.
- **POST /users/:id**: Delete a user by ID.

## Key Contributions

- Designed and implemented the application's back-end using Node.js and Express.js, creating RESTful API routes for user management.
- Utilized Sequelize, a MySQL ORM, to interact with the database, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Implemented a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface for data entry and management.
- Enabled user data creation, editing, and deletion, ensuring accurate and up-to-date booking information.
- Demonstrated proficiency in database configuration and management by setting up and connecting to a MySQL database.

## Implementation Details

### HTTP Methods

- GET: Retrieves a list of all users or specific user data.
- POST: Creates a new user entry.
- PUT: Updates an existing user's information.
- DELETE: Deletes a user's record.

### Express.js Routing

- The Express.js framework is used to define routes that correspond to these HTTP methods, organized in the `routes/users.js` file.

### Controller Functions

- For each route, there are associated controller functions in the `controllers/userController.js` file. These controller functions handle the logic for interacting with the database and managing user data.

### Database Operations

- The Sequelize ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is used to interact with the MySQL database. Controller functions use Sequelize methods like `findAll`, `create`, `update`, and `destroy` to perform database operations.

### Route Endpoints

- The API endpoints are defined in the `routes/users.js` file. For example:
  - GET /users retrieves a list of all users.
  - POST /users creates a new user.
  - PUT /users/:id updates a user by ID.
  - DELETE /users/:id deletes a user by ID.

### Response Formats

- Depending on the operation, the controller functions send responses in appropriate formats. For instance, when creating a new user, the response might be in JSON format confirming the successful addition of the user.

## Best Practices and Recommendations

- **File Structure and Organization**: Maintain a well-structured file organization for code readability and scalability.

- **Data Validation**: Implement data validation to ensure security and data integrity.

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for both front-end and back-end components.
